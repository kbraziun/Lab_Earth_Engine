# A brief primer on Google Earth Engine

Lab meeting 2019-05-13

## Resources

There are many good workshops and tutorials, for example:

- [Software carpentry-style tutorial](https://geohackweek.github.io/GoogleEarthEngine/)
- [US-IALE workshop by NASA DEVELOP](https://github.com/fortCollinDev/modelingShortCourse)
- [Earth Engine 101 by GEE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZxRKMie8dfTvBmUNOO0TFMkd7ELGWf3WjX0JvESZdOE/edit#heading=h.410q8l7bcr6j)

When you are comfortable with the basics, explore the [Google Earth Engine API](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/).

## Lab meeting prep

- Bring your personal computer, so you can follow along and experiment with the code editor.
- Create a Google Earth Engine account. [Sign up here.](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/#!/)

## Why Google Earth Engine

- Free and powerful cloud computing
- Massive online public data archive, no download needed
- Upload your own data
- Built-in version control, collaborative environment
- Lots of documentation and example code, active user community
- Living platform: new datasets, build add interface for end users, etc.

## Some caveats

- Learning curve
  - Uses Javascript, with own set of classes, functions
  - Can use Python with additional steps
- Import and export can be slow
- Limited number of built-in algorithms
- Not for cartography

## Introduction to code editor window

The main interaction with GEE is through the [code editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com/).
